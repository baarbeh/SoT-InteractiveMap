# SoT-InteractiveMap
Status of Treaties Interactive Map - Open AIR

This interactive map shows the number of international Intellectual Property treaties ratified by African countries between 1885 and 2015.
Data for this project was compiled from [WIPO] (http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/), the [Convention on Biodiversity] (https://www.cbd.int/abs/nagoya-protocol/signatories/default.shtml), and [UPOV] (http://www.upov.int/upovlex/en/notifications.jsp)

Interactive map was developed based on this [tutorial] (http://www.cartographicperspectives.org/index.php/journal/article/view/cp76-donohue-et-al/1307). 

Mapbox Studio was used to create the mapping solution, and [Range Touch] (https://github.com/nelsonic/range-touch) was used to make the slider touch compatible.
